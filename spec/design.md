## Terminology design aids

“Why do we need to design terminology? Can’t we simply write our ideas down, look up some definitions and add them, or search for some explanatory texts if clear definitions lack in the heat of the writing process?

We don’t have a problem, do we? Why all the fuzz and juggling all these terms and definitions about terms and definitions? It’s not getting better, is it. Let me just write my piece and add some glossary items and we’re done. We skip all the academic hassle about meaning, concepts, artefacts, and what have we. Let’s get work done!”

If communication and understanding were just that easy…

Hold your breath for the magic word, the solution for everything in terminology design. First we have to make a small, but very important detour.

For who are we doing this, what can this person do with it and what is the unique result?

Are you going to be faster, better, easier-going in writing texts?

Just imprint this paragraph:

**Authors and curators** of texts can follow this guideline for terminology design in order to **create their terminology**, **invent smart criteria to distinguish their concepts from others**, thereby identifying their own concepts clearer, understand their peers better and finally **be understood better** and quicker by others.

Oops the magic word is in there! Have you been able to locate it? No? Keep going!

Most term definitions in the world do not comply with the distinguishing-criteria rule, and that’s the uniqueness of this Guide: it’s easy to follow and the result is an immensely improved terminology.

This guide is not going in depth like TNO Terminology Design does. We offer the best of both worlds: simplicity and speed and about eighty percent the right way how it should be done.

Before we’ll share the *all-encompassing solution* in just one word, we’ll lay out the step-by-step to get your terminology done.

Tada! Our guidelines are:
1. Start writing your objectives and ideas, and identify your concepts behind the terms you use (why-how-what is it?) 
2. Write the concept in a specific way: formulate criteria (why-how-what is it?) when you bet that confusion might  arise
3. As long as a term is not understood by the target group: replace it with your criteria (why-how?) 
4. As soon as it’s understood: define the term with those criteria and replace the criteria with the term. (why-how?) 

Although we inevitably introduce some unexplained terms with an example, here’s an example:

Step 1 - In the digital identity field you might want to write a vision document on how Self-Sovereign Identity could work in Health Care. One of the concepts / mechanisms within healthcare is be absolutely sure who(se knee) is going to be operated next. You write how that’s going to work out.

 Step 2 - “Validation” and “Verification” of a visitor at the desk of the outpatient clinic are terms that might conflate with the “authentication” that needs to be done: “Is the person really who he says he is?!”

You decide to distinguish validation and verification with a criterium for verification: 

> it must be “an automatic digital process” to be verification.

The criterium is simple: must be an automatic digital process. 

This distinguishing criterium comes in handy because validation can also be something a person does!
Decryption on a computer is verification, checking a passport by the desk officer is not.

Step 3 - Although you wrote ‘authentication is partly done by *an automatic digital process* called verification’, your team members are confused by the word ‘digital’. One of them brings forward that ‘computerized’ instead of digital is clearer and the team agrees unanimously.

For the sake of the team members that weren’t present at the meeting, you leave the criteria in the text:

‘authentication is partly done by *an automatic computerized process* called verification’

In this process you could look for over-arching or adjacent term definitions (with criteria!) that match your concept. That’s when consensus building comes in as a spin-off of your terminology design.

Still wondering what the magic word could be? No worries! Ladies and gentlemen … (drum roll) … the magic word in designing all your terms, defining them in a reproducible way so that anyone could identify your concepts, understand your ideas better and apply the word by himself or herself…… (drums hold!)…:
Criteria!

A least one well-formulated criterium we need per term definition, or should we say *only one* we might need to offer a way to distinguish wether something is 
- included or excluded from the definition
- inside or outside of the concept behind the term
Criteria! It just pure magic!

Wait, wait. Come back. Please? Ah, happily you’re still here. We need to share a question at this stage. Remember, we’re trying to offer a simple and speedy guideline to create great terminology for your project. 

Why is it so d.mn difficult to get people to write proper criteria? If the “magic word” ‘criteria’ delivers to the promise, why all the fuzz, why are nearly all definitions in the digital world without proper criteria??

Because…
- it’s work, it’s a task
- it needs practise
- it needs communication
- it needs understanding others
- it needs the dear wish to want to understand other people first, before you push to be understood.

Isn’t the magic word a bit cruel? It snatches the average human being in the heart of their weakness: understanding others. Yet "mutual understanding" is needed to be able to formulate criteria.
