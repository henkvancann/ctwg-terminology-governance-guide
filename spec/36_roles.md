## Roles

This section is informative and intends to clarify people's different viewpoints when looking at concepts and terminology.

We offer:
1. minimalistic use cases for them
2. the necessary consecutive steps to fulfill their use case

Reminder: This governance guide is about **Specifications** and (their) **Glossaries** Our tooling Spec-Up-T handles both in one go and this might be confusing sometimes.

::: todo Important
 Have a look at the diagram and role descriptions in the [Spec-Up-T documentation](https://trustoverip.github.io/spec-up-t-website/docs/intro) first!

### Role: Reader
Who uses the Github.io website, reads concepts in text and terminology in glossaries (for example, generated by Spec-Up), and has its tailor-made contextual glossary that generates pop-ups here and there in the text offered. The reader optionally follows links by clicking on them.

### Role: Curator
Uses a Web user interface ([[ref: WebUI]]) of GitHub.com, the command-line and an IDE and git and browser extensions to check logical consistency & meaning of term definitions in a particular context and uses browser extensions to harvest a personal collection of term definitions based on those recommended by the specification authors.

### Role: Specification CONTENT author, describing concepts
Focuses on content and concepts of the group they belong to. 

:::warning Warning Notice
Whenever they change **terminology**, he should be aware that it's the responsibility of the *terminology author* to make changes to defs and refs!

They use browser extensions to check the technical consistency of the text's links and harvest a personal collection of term definitions.


### Role: Specification TERMINOLOGY author, covering concepts

### Role: ToIP glossary maintainer
This role uses a source management tool. Reads and compares concepts in text and terminology in glossaries (for example, generated by Spec-Up) to use within their "own" over-arching ToIP glossary. They build as much consensus around terms and concepts as possible and promote using the ToIP glossary as reference material.
