## Roles
This section is informative.

A clear specification of roles in- and outside an average ToIP "group" might clear up the different viewpoints people have when looking at concepts and terminology.

1. minimalistic use cases for them
2. then the necessary consecutive steps to get there

### Role: ToIP glossary maintainer
Uses: Source management tool. Reads and compares concepts in text and terminology in glossaries, (for example generated by Spec-Up) to use within his/hers "own" over-arching ToIP glossary. He/she builds as much consensus around terms and concepts and promotes using the ToIP glossary as reference material.

### Role: Specification content author, describing concepts
Focusses on content of  definitions covering concepts of the group he/she belongs to. Uses: an IDE, git and a browser extension, to edit  Spec-Up markdown files for his/her specific context (mental model) in a version managed environment, authenticated, to write the concept and specification and offer this as a PR. He/she uses browser extensions to check technical consistency of the links in the text and harvests a personal collection of term definitions.

### Role: Specification terminology author, covering concepts
Focusses on term definitions covering concepts of the group he/she belongs to. Uses: an IDE, git and a browser extension, to edit  Spec-Up markdown files for his/her specific context (mental model) in a version managed environment, authenticated, to write the concept and specification and offer this as a PR. He/she uses browser extensions to check technical consistency of the links in the text and harvests a personal collection of term definitions. Specification author terms that cover those concepts.

### Role: Curator
Uses an IDE and git and browser extensions, to check logical consistency & meaning of term definition in a certain context and uses browser extensions to harvest a personal collection of term definitions, based on those recommended by the specification authors.

### Role: Reader
Uses github.io website, reads concepts in text and terminology in glossaries, (for example generated by Spec-Up) with its own tailor-made contextual glossary that generates pop-ups here and there in the text offered.


### Questions and usecases

| TBW |

How are the following roles supported (applies to either KERISSE or TEv2)?

1. Authors of technical documents that need to reference glossaries/glossary entries
2. Authors of glossary terms
3. Curators of glossaries (manage changes, toolsets, etc.)
4. Glossary Tech developers
5. Instructors and educators for organizations creating and using glossaries and glossary terms for ToIP-related documentation?

What are the supported source document types for:
1. Documents that reference glossary terms and concepts
2. Authoring terms and related extended definitions, examples, and illustrations (in-depth explanations?)
3. Term/Concept metadata (gdocs? JSON?)

## Curation of Concepts vs. Terminology

Why do github action of a scope go off on 'push' and 'by hand' (and not on 'gollum'; the latter is the wiki server)?

Because 

An author
why will a changed Source of the Terminology not automatically (via github actions scripts) be promulgated to the production environment of the Scope and elsewhere if other Scopes use the MRG at hand?:

because a curator has to check the content and invoke the github action script by hand.

Guidance on diagrams (and managing their source) would be helpful. 

For example, should diagrams always be rendered and controlled as png and preferably svg, too (for presentations, etc)?

Is it feasible to offer links in diagrams and if so, can we check and repair broken links easily?
