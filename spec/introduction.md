## Introduction

In 2021 TrustoverIP published the [Specification for Creating and Using Terms](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Specification+for+Creating+and+Using+Terms)

In the years to follow the guide to create [Term wikis](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Terms+Wikis) has been established. It gives extensive instructions on how to create wikis, use markdown and hyperlinks, etc.

As the number of implementations grew, maintenance of the wikis became out of sync, the number of broken links increased, duplicate definitions of terms and deviations from the structure and governance offered.

> Darrell O'donnell: As I am deep in a rabbit hole looking at definitions a thought occured to me. We may end up with “over-defined” terms - meaning the definition exists in multiple places. Have you considered that case?
> I believe that a ToIP Master : ToIP Specification conflict should be avoided. If a spec needs a different term than is in the Master glossary, then the conflict should be resolved:
adjust Master Glossary; or
create new term in Spec
> BUT where we end up looking at terms that are managed even further afield, this gets really hard.
Just curious if this is a condition you’ve thought of.
> I see the following possibilities:
> - multiple def: in single document (this is just sloppy work - but easy to do, for me at least)
> - duplicated def: - say in Spec and ToIP Master Glossary

Some of these developments are part of the natural evolution of concepts and terminologies within an umbrella organisation like ToIP. Others could be more streamlined.

This specification intends to offer a *[[ref: Guide]]*. A Guide has little or no normative statements as it describes an advise on how to create a specific terminology by sticking to guidance and certain rules to know how to **write or adopt definitions**, how to reference them and where to store and manage them:

- reuse the **specification template** and how to do this in a sustainable manner
- reuse the **ToIP over-arching glossary** where possible
- avoid breaking links in the future
- use the full power of **def, refs and aliases** in individual documents based on Spec-Up (which is behind specification template as of 202?)
- be able to generate your documents in a few leading **style-guides** like ToIP, ISO, etc.
- Last but not least: any group with a certain scope will need to **source manage their own definitions** or views on definition, which means that we need to ear mark creation and updates with time & author.
