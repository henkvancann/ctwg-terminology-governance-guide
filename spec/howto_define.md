## How to write definitions in your terminology

1. Repeat the objectives or goals of a certain community
2. Discuss, communicate towards consensus about a certain concept or term
3. Define the scope or mental model together
4. Write criteria for which is inside or outside the reach of a certain term

Needless to say, this process is important for mutual understanding.

### How to write criteria

1. Criteria must make sense for all roles involved in the community

> For example a criterium like "A self-adressing identifier is automatically a self-sovereign identifier, but not the other way around." might not resonate with a Reader.

2. Criteria should be deterministic, either to be in or out the definition

> [[def: abbrev, abbreviation]]
> ~ a shorthand in capitals for a [[ref: term]]. It may contain special characters. It may not contain spaces.  
> Criterium for not being an abbreviation: If the word is not in uppercase, in our context the word is more likely to be an [[ref: alias]] for the term.

3. Formulate edge cases: What is just included a defnition, and what is just excluded from a definition?!

> E.g. X.509 could be an abbreviation, and 'EU ID' is not an abbreviation

::: note Basic Note
A lot of adding-criteria work needs to be done, before we discuss anything like reusing definitions in another mental model. It just makes no sense to refer / link to a non-deterministic definition of somebody else, for this introduces confusion per definition: we think we are talking about the same, but most probably we're not!

Some good news is that the enhancement in writing down concepts and terminology can be done in parallel with other things:
- archiving old concept and glossaries
- tool development
- consensus building
But unfortunately **not together with referencing existing poorly-formulated definitions** because that'll put a burden on the future.
