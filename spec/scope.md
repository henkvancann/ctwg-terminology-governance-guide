## Scope

This Guide goes with the flow as much as it can. This means:
- git and github for version control, issue-handling and project management in the own github repo
- The existing Slack group CTWG for discussions
- Use of github wiki-based source management of terminologies
- Proposal to archive obsolete sources of terminology
- Reuse harvesting / consensus creation tools that are available and anticipate improvements of those
- Connect to TEv2 step by step
- Use Spec-Up / specification template and anticipate improvements of this
