## Terms and definitions

[[def: Guide, guide, guidelines]]

~ What is the criterium something being a Guide versus a Specification?
A Specification has enough [[ref: normative]] statements to be directly implementatable. 

[[def: normative]]

~ A theory is “normative” if it, in some sense, tells you what you should do - what action you should take.Also see [KERISSE](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary-unified?level=2#normative)

[[def: phrase]]

~ Something is a phrase when it's either a [[ref: term]], an [[ref: acronym]] or an [[ref: alias]] in the context of this [[ref: guide]].

[[def: term]]

~ The ToIP notation of a terminology item, that requires a definiton, that could have an acronym and zero or more aliasses. A term is supposed to be uniquely defined in a certain scope, but can have many exactly the same instances in a broader community.  
~ The term also serves as a key in the source management tool of ToIP terminology sources and to make a comparison among terms.  
~ Criterium: only if a certain word or [[ref: phrase]] in ToIP notation and first placed in the definition tag, then it's a term in the scope of this [[ref: guide]]. Only a term can have just one [[ref:acronym]].  
~ Also see [term](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/glossary-unified?level=2#term).

[[def: abbrev, acronym]]

~ a shorthand in capitals for a [[ref: term]]. It may contain special characters. It may not contain spaces.  
~ Criterium for not being an acronym: If the word is not in uppercase, in our context the word is more likely to be an [[ref: alias]] for the term.

[[def: alias]]

~ Any notation of a terminology item, that is an alternative for a term being defined. The alias also serves as a comparison among term definitions.  
~ An alias is typically a means to one-on-one relate specific wording to a term already defined. For example :
~ - Synonyms
~ - Plural - singular
~ - Different spelling
~ - Lowercase versus Uppercase 
~ - another (!) acronym
~ *Mind you: the most applicable acronym should be in [[ref:acronym]].*
~ Criterium: an alias | TBW |

[[def: title]]

~ A short unique tag assigned to the remote Spec-Up document containing the def for the term being referenced. So any Spec-Up document that uses remote refs would need to include a `title` section.
