The Terminology Governance Guide is an up-to-date guide of assimilated expertise within Trust-over-IP with regard to Concepts and Terminology. It's objective is to offer a comprehesive description of various data stores, tools and processes to manage terminology in a consistent and reproducable manner. The process intents to keep track of who did what in which role.
