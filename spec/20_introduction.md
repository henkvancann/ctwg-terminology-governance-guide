## Introduction

The Terminology Governance Guide is a 2024-2025 guide of assimilated expertise within Trust-over-IP about Concepts and Terminology. Its objective is to offer a comprehensive description of various data stores, tools, and processes to manage terminology, **albeit integrated in specification text**, consistently and reproducibly; the process intends to keep track of who did what in which role to terms and definitions.

The Spec-Up-T builders described the roles in the [documentation of Spec-Up-T](https://trustoverip.github.io/spec-up-t-website/).

This guide has a brief description of its history in the [annex](#Annex).
