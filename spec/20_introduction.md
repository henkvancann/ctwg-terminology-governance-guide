## Introduction

The Terminology Governance Guide is a 2024 guide of assimilated expertise within Trust-over-IP about Concepts and Terminology. Its objective is to offer a comprehensive description of various data stores, tools, and processes to manage terminology consistently and reproduciblyâ€”the process intends to keep track of who did what in which role.

The Spec-Up-T builders described the roles in the [documentation of Spec-Up-T](https://trustoverip.github.io/spec-up-t-website/).
