## Scope

This guide uses open-source technology as much as possible and sticks to best-of-breed tools:

- git and github for version control, issue-handling, and project management in the own github repo
- GitHub user management
- The existing Slack group CTWG for discussions
- Archive obsolete sources of terminology
- Reuse harvesting/consensus creation tools that are available and anticipate improvements in those
- Use Spec-Up / specification template and anticipate improvements to this

In 2024 we phased out:
- Use of github wiki-based source management of terminologies

In 2024 we postponed:
- Connect to TEv2 step by step

### Roadmap

How do TEv2, Spec-Up, and KERISSE relate? The goal is unification, and we prevent reinventing tools already in place. 

The issue of unification is currently open, but this guide might solve it with further designs. A sequence-numbered roadmap to unification (presuming that that's the goal) can be found below.

We plan to unify KERISSE with Spec-Up-T and its governance. This step means the github wiki-based source management of term definitions will be dropped. Like the CTWG Main Glossary, there will be a KERI glossary that xrefs to the Main ToIP glossary for all general and SSI terminology.
