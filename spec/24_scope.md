## Scope

This Guide uses tools currently in use and proven open-source technology as much as possible:

- git and github for version control, issue-handling and project management in the own github repo
- GitHub user management
- The existing Slack group CTWG for discussions
- Use of github wiki-based source management of terminologies
- Archive obsolete sources of terminology
- Reuse harvesting / consensus creation tools that are available and anticipate improvements of those
- Connect to TEv2 step by step
- Use Spec-Up / specification template and anticipate improvements of this

### Roadmap

How do TEv2, Spec-Up and KERISSE relate? The goal is unification and we prevent reinventing tools that are already in place. 

The issue of unification is currently open, but it might be solved with the design of this Guide. A sequence numbered roadmap to unification (presumming that that's the goal) can be found below.
