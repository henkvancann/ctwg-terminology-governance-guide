## Scope

This guide uses open-source technology as much as possible and sticks to best-of-breed tools:

- git and github for version control, issue-handling, and project management in the own github repo
- GitHub user management
- The existing Slack group CTWG for discussions
- Archive obsolete sources of terminology
- Reuse harvesting/consensus creation tools that are available and anticipate improvements in those
- Use Spec-Up / specification template and anticipate improvements to this

In 2024 we phased out:
- Use of github wiki-based source management of terminologies

In 2024 we postponed:
- Connect to TEv2 step by step
- The tooling around {TBW relations between terms}

### Roadmap

How do TEv2, Spec-Up, and KERIDoc relate? The goal is unification, and we prevent reinventing tools already in place. 

The issue of unification is currently open, but this guide might solve it with further designs. A sequence-numbered roadmap to unification (presuming that that's the goal) can be found below.

We have made a clearer distinction between what KERIDoc does and what Spec-Up-T does: KERIDoc is education on top op Spec-Up-T-based glossaries: 
1. the ToIP General Glossary
2. the ToIP Main Glossary
3. KERISuite Main glossary 

### Process

In the process we have dropped github wiki-based source management of term definitions. It's now done in Spec-Up-T
